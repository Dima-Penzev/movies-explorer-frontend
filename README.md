# Movies-explorer

This application is the final project of my training at Yandex.Practicum. In it, I developed both parts of the application: frontend and backend. The backend includes authorization, authentication and saving of your favorite movies. Validation of incoming data was carried out using the Joi library. Authorization, authentication and profile editing with validation of outgoing data were also implemented in the frontend part of the application. Validation was created using the React hook forms library. The logic of searching for movies by keyword and by duration was also developed. The movie search was done using an API request - "https://api.nomoreparties.co/beatfilm-movies " with subsequent filtering. It is possible to save your favorite movies in a separate place and delete them from there.
